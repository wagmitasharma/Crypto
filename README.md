# Crypto
Project implementing steganography in java.
Used Spring Boot framework.

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message (in this project, an image) in order to avoid detection;
the secret data is then extracted at its destination.

The message is encrypted in an image. This image can further be downloaded and decrypted to retrieve the message again.
